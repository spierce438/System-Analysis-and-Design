# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The Driverpass project was an attempt to design a website system that scheduled driving lessons for different drivers. The client was Liam, the owner of Driverpass. The system Liam wants to build is a way for new drivers to practice and test at the DMV.
What did you do particularly well?
I think my diagrams look very clean and hit on all the major parts require.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I struggled with the class diagrams as I was not sure which were the classes and methods.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I made sure to include all the needs within the use case diagram and include good security measures. It is so important to consider a user's needs when designing because sometimes the client does not consider all aspects of their wants when it pertains to the user needs.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach it by looking at the needs of the client and then ensure the align with the users needs, while maximizing security for both sides. I would continue to use limited login attempts, two-step verifications and a forgot password option.
